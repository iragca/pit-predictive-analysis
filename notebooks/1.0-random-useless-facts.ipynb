        "This research explores the semantic structure of thousands of public trivia statements—commonly known as “useless facts”—retrieved from the Random Useless Facts API. Although these facts are informal and often humorous, they represent a rich and diverse corpus of short natural-language statements. By applying two major unsupervised topic modeling methods, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), the study examines whether the seemingly chaotic collection of trivia exhibits coherent underlying themes.\n",
        "\n",
        "A complete computational pipeline is developed, encompassing data collection, text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, topic evaluation, and visualization. The pipeline identifies recurring themes embedded in the trivia corpus, such as biological phenomena, animal-related oddities, historical anecdotes, linguistic curiosities, and surprising scientific facts. Beyond analyzing trivia, the project demonstrates how modern topic modeling can effectively uncover structure within unstructured, non-technical, and multilingual text sources. The resulting framework provides a repeatable method for analyzing similar short-form text datasets."

        "“Useless facts” are pieces of trivia or curious fragments of information that are often surprising, entertaining, or obscure, yet rarely practical in daily life. Despite their seemingly trivial nature, these factoids circulate widely across digital platforms—particularly on social media, blogs, online forums, and dedicated trivia websites—where they captivate audiences by appealing to people’s natural curiosity and fascination with unexpected knowledge. The Random Useless Facts API serves as a public web service that aggregates thousands of these items, enabling programmatic access to randomly selected facts in multiple languages, including English and German. Each retrieved entry typically contains the text of the fact itself, a unique identifier, metadata regarding its original source, and a stable permalink for reference. The structured yet diverse nature of this content creates an opportunity for systematic computational analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "This study investigates the underlying semantic patterns present within a large collection of such “useless facts” through the use of topic modeling, a class of unsupervised machine learning methods designed to identify latent themes in textual data. Topic modeling algorithms group documents—here, individual fact statements—based on shared vocabulary and co-occurrence patterns, allowing researchers to uncover meaningful clusters without requiring manually annotated categories. To explore the thematic composition of the dataset, we implement and compare two widely used topic modeling approaches: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). These models provide complementary perspectives on the structure of the corpus, revealing which recurring subjects—such as animals, historical events, linguistic oddities, biological phenomena, or everyday objects—are most prevalent within the collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "To conduct this analysis, a complete machine learning pipeline is developed, covering all essential stages of text-based research. This pipeline begins with programmatically retrieving data from the API, followed by cleaning, preprocessing, and normalizing the text to ensure suitability for quantitative analysis. The next phase involves transforming the processed text into numerical feature representations using vectorization techniques such as TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words. These representations serve as inputs to the LDA and NMF models, which are then trained, tuned, and evaluated to determine the most coherent and interpretable topic structures. Finally, the identified topics are visualized, interpreted, and examined for linguistic and thematic insights. This end-to-end workflow ensures methodological rigor, reproducibility, and scalability, establishing a robust framework that can readily be adapted for analyzing similar text-rich datasets."

Despite their mundaneness, such facts could still reflect shared human interests, common cultural references, or frequently occurring knowledge domains.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Short and noisy text format — Each fact is typically only one or two sentences long, limiting contextual information that topic modeling methods rely on.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Semantic diversity — The corpus contains a wide range of content (biology, history, humor, linguistics, science, etc.), but without any explicit labeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Multilingual nature — The inclusion of multiple languages (e.g., English and German) introduces linguistic variability that complicates preprocessing and modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Absence of ground-truth categories — Because there is no predefined taxonomy of “useless facts,” fully unsupervised methods are required to identify meaningful patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given these challenges, the aim is to determine whether coherent themes can still emerge from such random and seemingly trivial content. Through topic modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), this study seeks to uncover the dominant themes present within the corpus, revealing the types of subjects people inadvertently encode into what is commonly perceived as insignificant information."
